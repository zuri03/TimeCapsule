TimeCapsule

capsule: a message to be sent out to a destination in the future
    - capsules can be sent as emails or text messages   
    - capsules can only include text 

Components/ MVP:
    client:
        - a web application 
        - only has a form for creating and submitting a new capsule
    API:
        - accepts forms from clients and inserts a new capsule record in the database
    Data Layer:
        - Write Cluster:
            - contians all of the new capsules
            - periodically replicates new capsules to read Cluster 
            - when new capules are submitted to the read cluster they are deleted from the write cluster
        - Read Cluster:
            - contains all of the capsules for storage
            - other components will read from this cluster to process and get details on capsules 
    Capsule Processing Layer:
        - processes and executes capsules
        - capsule processor:
            - uses the read cluster to determine which capsules are ready to be executed and creates a new event for the executor
        - capsule executor:
            - executes the capsule 
            - can send emails and text messages

Future Plans:
    - create a mobile app for submitting new capsules
    - allow users more customization when creating an email capsule such as formatting etc...
    - add user profiles to allow users to manage their capsules

TODO:
    - Set up initial project skeleton
    - workout finer details of implementation
    - create testing plan
